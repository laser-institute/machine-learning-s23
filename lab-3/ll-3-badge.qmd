As a reminder, to earn a badge for these learning labs, you will have to
respond to a set of prompts for two parts.

### Part I: Data Product

For the data product, you will interpret a different type of model -- a
model in a *regression* mode.

So far, we have specified and interpreted a *classification* model: one
predicting a dichotomous outcome (i.e., whether students pass a course).
In many cases, however, we are interested in predicting a continuous
outcome (e.g., students' number of points in a course or their score on
a final exam).

While many parts of the machine learning process are the same for a
regression machine learning model, one key part that is relevant to this
learning lab is different: their interpretation. The confusion matrix we
created to parse the predictive strength of our classification model
[does not pertain]{.underline} to regression machine learning models.
Different metrics are used. For this badge activity, you will specify
and interpret a regression machine learning model.

The requirements are as follows:

-   Change your outcome to **students' final exam performance** (note:
    check [the data
    dictionary](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset) for a
    pointer!).

-   Using the same data (and testing and training data sets), recipe,
    and workflow as you used in the case study, **change the mode** of
    your model from classification to regression and change the
    **engine** from a glm to an lm model.

-   **Interpret your regression machine learning model** in terms of
    three regression machine learning model metrics: **MAE**, **MSE**,
    and **RMSE**. Read about these metrics
    [here](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html#model-eval).
    Similar to how we interpreted the classification machine learning
    metrics, focus on the substantive meaning of these statistics.

Please use the code chunk below for your code:

```{r}

```

Please add your interpretations here:

-   MAE:

-   MSE:

-   RMSE:

### Part II: Reflect and Plan

1.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests
    that could be modeled using a *classification* machine learning
    model?

-   

3.  What is an example of an outcome related to your research interests
    that could be modeled using a *regression* machine learning model?

-   

3.  Look back to the study you identified for the first machine learning
    learning lab badge activity. Was the outcome one that is modeled
    using a classification or a regression machine learning model?
    Identify which mode(s) the authors of that paper used and briefly
    discuss the appropriateness of their decision.

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML
    header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata)
    at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header
    controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't
    actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R
    Markdown document to a
    [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file
    that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a
    formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan
    or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues
    with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on Posit Cloud by clicking the
    "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your
    document. See screenshot below.

### Receiving Your Machine Learning Badge

To receive credit for this assignment and earn your second ML Badge,
share the link to published webpage under the next incomplete badge
artifact column on the 2023 LASER Scholar Information and Documents
spreadsheet: <https://go.ncsu.edu/laser-sheet>.

Once your instructor has checked your link, you will be provided a
physical version of the badge below!
