### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Please read this article and then answer then response to the following
three questions.

> Baker, R. S., Esbenshade, L., Vitale, J., & Karumbaiah, S. (2023).
> Using Demographic Data as Predictor Variables: a Questionable Choice.
> *Journal of Educational Data Mining, 15*(2), 22-52.

Part A:

1.  In what ways could the inclusion of demographic variables as
    predictors potentially reinforce biases in predictive analytics
    within education?

2.  The authors argue that demographic variables should be used to
    validate fairness rather than as predictors within models. What are
    the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

3.  How could the limitations of categorization impact the use of
    demographic variables in predictive models?

Part B: Once again, use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU
Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a
research article, presentation, or resource that applies machine
learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests.
More specifically, please find an article in your field that utilizes in
*feature engineering*

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What is the data source used in the study?

    -   

3.  Why was feature engineering *useful* or even *necessary* in this
    study?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

For this data product, please add a feature (or several features)
*specific to one or more of the activity types* in the OULAD
interactions data, and then add these features to your model and
evaluate the accuracy. How did the accuracy appreciably change--if at
all? Please copy all of your code in one or more code chunks below.

```{r}

```

```{r}

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML
    header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata)
    at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header
    controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't
    actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R
    Markdown document to a
    [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file
    that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a
    formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan
    or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues
    with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on Posit Cloud by clicking the
    "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your
    document. See screenshot below.

### Receiving Your Machine Learning Badge

To receive credit for this assignment and earn your third ML badge,
share the link to published webpage under the next incomplete badge
artifact column on the 2023 LASER Scholar Information and Documents
spreadsheet: <https://go.ncsu.edu/laser-sheet>.

Once your instructor has checked your link, you will be provided a
physical version of the badge below!
